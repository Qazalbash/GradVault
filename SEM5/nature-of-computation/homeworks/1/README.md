# Purpose

This homework provides practice in working with different aspects of regular languages: the machines used to recognize them, the expressions used to describe them, and in reasoning about them in general.

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- know the state diagram representation of a DFA
- know the state diagram representation of a NFA
- know the conversion between an NFA and a DFA
- understand the relation between regular languages and NFAs and DFAs
- know regular expressions
- understand the relation between regular languages and regular expressions
- be familiar with proof techniques
- be able to build logical arguments

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw1.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to this assignment.

## 1.1 Solving the Problem Set

Insert your solutions in `solution` environments in `hw1.tex`. The file named `hw1.tex` in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your team's submission. Make sure that any included files, e.g. image files, are also present in the repository.

This is a team submission on GitHub and contributes to your _Submission Score_.

Deadline: 2359h on Fri, 23 Sep

## 1.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your buddy and on the assignment through a from which will be available on LMS with further instructions. The form will be due at the same time as the problem set.

This is an individual submission on LMS and contributes to your individual _Team Factor_ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission, inaccurate feedback, or non-participation in the team as assessed through peer feedback or GitHub contribution.

Deadline: 2359h on Fri, 23 Sep

# Grading

Your submission will be graded for correctness of your solutions. __Files that do no compile cannot be graded__. 

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.

# Discussion

Please use the following avenues:

- discuss with your buddy,
- the discussion forum on LMS,
