# Weekly Challenge 05: Master Theorem
# CS 412 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Spring 2023
***

Each Weekly Challenge (WC) invites you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. WCs may take on a variety of formats and be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. They may be attempted individually or in teams as indicated.

# Purpose

This WC explores the master theorem by asking you to design recurrences to meet a desired solution, and then to design corresponding algorithms.

# Background

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- an understanding of the master theorem
- knowledge of techniques to solve recurrence relations
- familiarity with algorithms
- the ability to program in python
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX

# Task and Submission

The task for this WC is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. You will enter your solution in the indicated space in the same file. Make sure to include in your repository any supporting files needed for successful compilation. The files in your repository at the time of the submission deadline will be considered your submission.

# Grading

The score earned by your submission will be assigned to the team assuming that the buddies contributed equally. To confirm, teams will be occasionally called in for a viva on their submission. If any of the members is unable to explain the submission or does not appear for the scheduled viva, the _team_ will lose marks not only for that WC but for previous WCs in which they were awarded marks based on trust. You are encouraged to report non-contributing buddies through the [appropriate form](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/2616/quizzes/7187).
