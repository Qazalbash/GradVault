Livestreaming schedule: music, art, literature and events from Australia and beyond

Music
• 21–22 March: Members of the beleaguered live music scene have banded together to create Isol-Aid, a “socially (media) distanced music festival” featuring 74 Australian musicians including Angie McMahon, Julia Jacklin, Stella Donnelly, Alice Skye, Didirri and heaps of others. The two-day festival will run from midday to midnight on Saturday and Sunday, with artists streaming 20-minute sets from self-isolation live on their Instagram accounts. It’s free but viewers are encouraged to stream or buy merchandise to support artists, and donate to a fundraiser set up by Support Act.
• 21-22 March: Erykah Badu will be performing a bedroom concert with songs chosen by poll – and it only costs a buck to get in. Stay tuned to her Instagram account for details.
• 21 March: Australian garage rockers the Naysayers have announced a “live stream from quarantine” in lieu of the gig they were to play at Melbourne’s Post Office Hotel. They’ll be streaming  from one of the band members’ living rooms on Saturday.
• From 27 March: The Melbourne Digital Concert Hall is hoping to start streaming pay-for-play concerts soon, kicking off with an online music festival 27–29 March.
• Ongoing: If classical music is your bag, our UK colleagues have a rolling list of “quarantine soirees” being updated daily. It features information about on-demand opera and archival recordings from some of Europe’s most high-profile performing arts companies and performers, including New York’s Metropolitan Opera, the London Symphony Orchestra and the beloved cellist/activist Yo-Yo Ma.
• Ongoing: After the success of its first foray into livestreaming concerts on Monday night, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra plans to continue to livestream during the shutdown period. On the schedule are performances of Beethoven and Mendelssohn, Bach and works from its schools program.
• Ongoing: Surry Hills Live was funded by the City of Sydney to create and promote local live gigs in the suburb’s pubs – which have been cancelled, so it has moved the gigs online. Evening shows will be streaming through March.
Theatre and cabaret
• 20-21 March: The Canadian theatre company Theatre Replacement has begun streaming performances of its production Mine – in which a group of gamer/performers aged 11 to 46 enact different mother-son narratives from popular culture, using the video game Minecraft. Streamed performances will take place on Friday and Saturday.
• 23 March: Melbourne’s Arts Centre is closed until 13 April but an upcoming performance of Exposing Edith, a cabaret based around the life – and death – of the French singer Edith Piaf, will be livestreamed from Hamer Hall on Monday at 11am.
Animals
• Ongoing: Zoos Victoria has launched Animal House, a selection of (so fare) four live feeds from its animal enclosures in Melbourne and Werribee zoos. Watch the giraffes munch their way through afternoon, see the penguins get fed (or a naughty seagull steal a pilchard), coo over the sleepy snow leopard cubs or the lions lolling about in the sun.
• Ongoing: For those in the US – or those simply up late at night everywhere else – the Smithsonian national zoo in Washington DC has set up live feeds of its lion enclosure, giant pandas troop, elephants and … naked mole rats. All creatures great and small, etc.

• Ongoing: The most joyful animal live feed on the internet must be Monterey Bay Aquarium’s sea otter cam. Watch the otters frolick and swim about, blissfully free of concerns about coronavirus or global economic meltdown. Look how much fun they’re having!
Visual art
• 1-17 May: Head On photo festival in Sydney will move online, with webinars and online events. The full program will be announced in April.
• Ongoing: The National Gallery of Victoria has opened its collection and moved its programming online, with virtual tours, online collection galleries, ebooks and activities for children.
Literature
• 9 May: Yarra Valley writers festival in Victoria, Australia, will be livestreamed. Online viewing tickets will go on sale in early April.
• Ongoing: The Australian writer Kirsten Krauth has created the Facebook group Writers Go Forth. Launch. Promote. Party for writers whose publicity tours and in-store events for new-release books have been cancelled. The group is quickly becoming a one-stop shop for authors announcing the details of virtual Q&As and readings through Facebook and Instagram Live.
