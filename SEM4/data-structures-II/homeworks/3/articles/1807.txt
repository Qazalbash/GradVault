Glastonbury: tell us how you feel about the festival's cancellation

News that the Glastonbury festival 2020 has been cancelled to prevent the spread of coronavirus will have come as a shock to many.
The festival’s 50th anniversary was set to take place this June, but organisers have decided to implement a fallow year and postpone until 2021.
The festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis wrote on social media that a cancellation was the “only viable option” in light of the pandemic.
We’d like to hear from readers who are affected by the cancellation.
