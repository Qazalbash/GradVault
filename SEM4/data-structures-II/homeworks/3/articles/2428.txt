New Zealand tells arrivals to self-isolate for two weeks, including citizens

New Zealand will require people who arrive in the country – including returning Kiwis – to self-isolate for a 14 days as the country locks down to ward off the spread of coronavirus, excluding people from the Pacific Islands.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the measure on Saturday after an emergency meeting of cabinet.
“We do not take these decisions lightly,” she said.
“Alongside Israel and a small number of Pacific islands who have effectively closed their borders, this decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,” she said.

Ardern said the measure applied to people, and not goods, though gave an exemption to people arriving from the Pacific – a region largely devoid of the virus.
The decisions will take effect as of midnight local time Saturday into Sunday. The decision will be reviewed in 16 days.
New Zealand has just six cases of the disease to date, and none that have been transmitted through the community.
Ardern also announced cruise ships would not be allowed to dock in New Zealand until at least 30 June.
She also encouraged all New Zealanders to avoid all non-essential travel overseas.
Earlier on Saturday, the government cancelled the national remembrance service in honour of the Christchurch mosque attacks, which took place on 15 March last year.
