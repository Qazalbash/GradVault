The Archers – an everyday story of coronavirus-free folk? | Brief letters

You reported that the Australian newspaper the NT News printed an extra eight pages (theguardian.com, 5 March) to be used as toilet paper after coronavirus fears prompted customers to bulk-buy, leaving some supermarket shelves bare. If the Guardian was to follow suit, rather than leave the pages blank, could you print the government’s latest advice, as it seems to be changing daily?Robert HewittLondon
• There were only two copies of the Guardian left at my newsagent on Monday, so I bought them both in case there’s a shortage later this week.Steve FlemingClaygate, Surrey
• John Crace should take comfort from the fact that all sporting events have been cancelled for the foreseeable future. His beloved Spurs can’t win, lose or draw. In fact, they won’t be playing at all – and on current form it’s a case of no change there. Keith ParkerBearsted, Kent
• As there is a lack of sport to report and therefore plenty of spare space in your newspaper, might it be a good idea to extend the puzzles pages so that all of us over-70s who are having to cancel our social activities have something to keep us occupied?Rae GibbensWhitstable, Kent
• If I knew how to get there, I’d move to Ambridge. No sign or mention in The Archers of any coronavirus yet.Margaret HarrisIsleworth, London
• I have just made a batch of grapefruit marmalade, well set at a high temperature. Should be enough to beat Covid-19. Something to do in isolation.Catriona ToddAston Clinton, Buckinghamshire
