Rolling in the aisles: Australians turn to TikTok to mock toilet paper panic-buying

Panic-buying toilet paper in response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has become a meme on social media, with young Australian TikTok users mocking those who are stripping supermarket shelves bare.
Last week Woolworths announced it would be rationing toilet paper after people began stockpiling the domestic essential, causing supplies to dwindle in many shops.
The #ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it was dubbed on Twitter, has inspired a wave of content on TikTok, the video app popular among teenagers and younger users.
TikToks are short videos, between 15 and 60 seconds, where users create content to the backing of film dialogue or music.
One, set to the tune made for TikTok, It’s Corona Time, has been liked more than 70,000 times and shows dozens of shoppers running towards a freshly stocked shelf of toilet paper.

Another, set to the Avengers theme song and showing a flood of customers with empty trollies, has stacked up over 18,000 likes.

This one shows a young Woolworths worker listing sold-out items such as long-life milk and hand sanitiser, and has gained over 114,000 likes.

Woolworths said it was working to restore supplies, with long-life food also in high demand.
Another, set to the theme music used in the You Wouldn’t Steal a Car anti-piracy campaign of the 2000s, received 33,000 likes and features a young man parodying the ad.

One TikTok user also captured a serious dispute. Two women, at a Coles in Melbourne, are shown fighting over the last available packet of toilet rolls.
One woman, with five packs in her trolley, says “I was here first”, before they both grab the tissue. Other customers step in to pull her away and she leaves disgruntled.
On Sunday police charged two women over a separate incident, an alleged fight over toilet paper in a Chullora supermarket.
“We just ask that people don’t panic like this when they go out shopping,” New South Wales police acting inspector Andrew New said. “There is no need for it. It isn’t the Thunderdome, it isn’t Mad Max, we don’t need to do that.”
