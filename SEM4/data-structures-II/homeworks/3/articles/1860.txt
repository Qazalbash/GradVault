When George Orwell’s marmalade was too sweet for some | Brief letters

Philip Collier (Letters, 26 February) was surprised at the absence of body temperature checks at Manchester airport on incoming passengers. Can I suggest passengers in this situation purchase a thermometer for less than a fiver, use it, and self-isolate if necessary. The nanny state cannot totally replace personal responsibility, or, indeed, initiative. Liam Pluck Enniskerry Village, Co Wicklow
• While we’re all grateful to be spared photo opportunities like the previous flood emergency one of Boris Johnson gurning as he pretended to mop the floor of someone’s flooded home, perhaps we should know his view on the coronavirus pandemic. Who’s advised him to self-isolate this early?Christine ButterworthPenzance, Cornwall
• Just wait, Zoe Williams (Shortcuts, G2, 25 February). Get to 70-plus and you’ll soon realise it’s not just “people with disabilities who especially need access to public toilets so they can leave the house”.Diana Clark (aged 74)Chiddingfold, Surrey
• It would surely be a mistake to conclude the marmalade correspondence this year (Letters, 24 February) without recalling that George Orwell had his very own recipe. However, in an unpublished essay for the British Council, entitled British Cookery, an editor commented, “Bad recipe! – too much sugar and water”.Peter BettsLiverpool
• Perhaps Leonard Barras, the Geordie surrealist, has the last word with his 1982 publication “Bluebottles on My Marmalade”.Malcolm AbbsLondon
