Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson's travels: selfies, shows and beachside strolls before coronavirus diagnosis

They are one of the highest profile Hollywood couples who attract wellwishers and autograph hunters in droves.
So when it was discovered that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson had tested positive for coronavirus while in Australia, the premier of Queensland let it be known that anyone who came into close contact with them should self-isolate.

Social media shows the celebrity couple came into contact with quite a few people, though how many of those would qualify as “close contact” is unclear.
Close contact is defined as being face to face with someone for at least 15 minutes, or being in the same enclosed space for at least two hours, so it is highly unlikely any quick chance encounters would lead to a transmission.
Here is a timeline sourced from publicly available information of where Hanks and Wilson had been in the days leading up to their diagnoses.
12 March – Gold Coast hospital
On Thursday, Hanks and Wilson confirmed that they had tested positive for Covid-19, and were currently in a hospital on the Gold Coast.
Hanks had been in Queensland filming for an as yet untitled project about Elvis Presley, directed by Baz Luhrmann. “Tom has been having a wonderful time on the Gold Coast and we are so lucky to have Tom in Queensland,” Palaszczuk said on Thursday.

 Hello, folks. Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We’ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves! Hanx!

9 March – Sydney harbour
Three days earlier, the couple shared multiple shots of a cruise they took on Sydney harbour.
Despite the pair posting photos with fans, Palaszczuk said that only people with “over 15 minutes of being in very close contact” were at risk, and “a selfie wouldn’t count as that”.

7 March – Sydney Opera House
Wilson performed at the iconic venue on the night of 7 March. The Opera House confirmed that Wilson performed in the Utzon Room, a performance attended by approximately 207 people, including Hanks.
“Following news that the couple have tested positive for coronavirus in Queensland, the Opera House is in touch with NSW Health and Queensland Health and will be acting on their advice,” a spokeswoman said.

It’s as yet unknown when Hanks and Wilson entered Australia, but it is clear the Wilson was in Los Angeles as of 28 February – at a charity event for breast cancer research.

24 February – Hanks in LA
Similarly, Hanks and Wilson were in Los Angeles on 24 February.
11 February – Hanks and Wilson at Oscars
Hanks and Wilson attended the Oscars awards ceremony in LA, where Hanks was nominated for best supporting actor for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.
However, it is unlikely he had contracted the virus at this point, a month before his diagnosis.

5 February – Hanks eats 50c wings at Gold Coast restaurant
However, it is clear that Hanks was also in Australia prior to his attendance at the Oscars, with Brisbane’s Courier Mail reporting that he shared a meal of 50c chicken wings on the Gold Coast with some fans.
Again, it is unlikely the Oscar-winning actor had contracted Covid-19 at this point.
2 February – Mt Warning in NSW
Similarly, the actor posed for this photograph at a restaurant in NSW as early as 2 February.
