Buy plays, donate tickets, protect workers: an action plan for theatre during Covid-19

‘Buy a play!’Laura Wade, playwrightMay I suggest reading some plays? There’s a quiet joy in spending an evening with a playscript: you get to cast the actors and imagine their performances, design your own set, get lost in the shimmering possibilities of a production with an unlimited budget. Most modern plays can be read in one sitting (available to buy online in hard copy or for e-reader) and if you do need to take a break in the middle, you’ll find the loo queue pleasingly short.
Some people find it hard to read a play off the page – and it probably is until you’ve practised a bit. I find it easier if I take a picture of the cast list, so I don’t keep flicking back when I can’t remember who Jerry is or who Caroline is married to. I tell students of playwriting to read a play they love multiple times: you see the structure emerge on subsequent readings, new things pop out at you.
It’s a different experience from seeing a play live, which, of course, is the thing we all love most, but it might keep you going till we can see each other in the circle bar again.
‘We need universal basic income now’Caroline Horton, theatre-makerAs one of the UK’s five million self-employed workers without sick pay, watching theatres close overnight has been frightening. Projects are on hold or cancelled, so our income has stopped. Arts Council England has shown great compassion and leadership, despite their funding having been repeatedly cut, working fast to reassure and support the creative sector while the government ignores the problem. A temporary introduction of universal basic income, requiring no complex assessment processes, would deal with this problem instantly and would cost the government far less than the bailouts and clear-up following the 2008 crash. Thank you to the Arts Council – I hope the support you are offering organisations and other regularly funded bodies is passed on to freelancers – but honestly, what, if anything, is the government going to do?

‘Collaborators – match up online!’Danusia Samal, actor and writerMental health is as important as physical in this trying time. We need to stay creative – that doesn’t have to be alone. Technology can keep us collaborating remotely. For example: writers and performers can match up. After a series of video calls discussing what they want to make, the writer writes the actor a piece, with guidance from a director. The actor rehearses at home, with the director Skyping in. They film their piece (every actor knows how to self-tape!) and it is streamed online. I plan to set this up, so get in touch if you’re interested.
‘If you can, donate rather than request a refund’Roy Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan, ADs, and Stephen Freeman, executive director, Royal ExchangeAs for so many of our peers, the majority of our income is from ticket sales. Suspending all our performances makes maintaining our business virtually impossible. So we, and others across our sector, are asking our incredible audiences who have tickets for a show to donate the price of that purchase to us rather than claim a refund. It means we can continue to support our artists, explore moving offstage projects into online forums, and ensure that during this time we can remain connected to our communities and do what we do best: think of creative ways to keep cultural activity alive.
‘Recognise the media that communicate’Peter Brook, directorThe stage and its audiences – our basic medium – has been taken away. So we have to recognise the media that communicate at the moment, such as television and the internet. Right now, they are the way anyone can express anything. Television is having to bear a huge load and is under a great strain. I send deep wishes to all. We are all in this together.

‘Protect our most marginalised voices’Suba Das, artistic director, HighTideWe must look at our responsibilities towards theatre’s workforce – not just contractually but also morally. Zero-hour and freelance contracts are a norm in our sector – whether front of house, back of house or in the office. Some of these people are the first faces you see when you walk into a theatre but they don’t have the protection of a salaried post. These were once permanent positions. During this crisis we run the risk of losing that workforce if they have to seek alternative employment. We’ve always known our business is uncertain, but it is especially so if you’re socio-economically deprived - which in the UK is shockingly more likely if you’re a woman, a person of colour or have a disability. For these people, pursuing a career in theatre has required grit and resilience because our sector is still so very unequal and untransparent in access and opportunity. If we’re not really proactive in thinking about the mental and physical wellbeing of our most marginalised voices in this period, we will lose them. And marginal voices are always our most exciting, innovative talent - our HighTide alumni from Vinay Patel to Sophie Ellerby prove that. Some of these artists and workers have grinned and borne their greater struggle for years for the love and magic of theatre, but this may be the tipping point. How we act now will dictate whether they wish to remain in our sector and it really will be our loss. Diversity is not charity, it’s simply good business sense, and we must remember that right now.
‘Cherish theatre memories’Ellie Keel, producer and founder of the Women’s Prize for PlaywritingI am focusing on morale. It is such a bland word, but vital in this context of uncertainty. Theatre-makers are asking themselves: “What is the point of being an artist who makes work for live consumption, if live events are literally against the law?” These are people who already, even without a pandemic, frequently question the practicality of their career choices. What artists need is encouragement and communication – from their peers but, crucially, from audiences. We need the public to delve into their memories, individual and collective, recent and distant, and recall examples of live entertainment that has changed their life. They need to think about the time a line was spoken and you swallowed hard because you thought you were the only person who had felt that thing. The stories, the characters, the music, the comedy, the performances that have changed our perspectives, lifted our spirits, boosted our confidence, made our days, inspired our minds and moved our hearts. Hearing about these moments will sustain artists through these dark days and remind us why we do it. This dialogue between consumers and creators of live art, cherishing the unforgettable specialness of what artists create, is the key to getting through this and onwards to great, joyful liveness once again.

 Rod Dixon … ‘It’s important to share what we’re doing.’
‘Build communities’Rod Dixon, artistic director, Red LadderTheatre creates instant communities. We at Red Ladder have our own supporter community through a membership scheme called Ladderistas. We will be sending them newsletters which will serve to keep that sense of belonging so essential at a time of isolation. We know the strength of communities from our non-theatre touring circuit. We can’t be there, but we will keep talking. It’s important to share what we are doing – such as Red Ladder paying and supporting our freelancers – as much as we can. Many theatres and companies have these schemes: sign up, support us, keep in touch and help us to keep and build vital relationships for the future.
‘Reflect, study, refresh’Sarah Argent, theatre-maker, writer, directorThese challenging times which have forced us to step off the treadmill of production could be an opportunity for reflection, study and artistic refreshment. We could read or re-read books by artists who excite us and watch recordings of their work (increasingly archive material and livestreams are available online but there could be more – could the National Theatre and others make their broadcasts available?). We could contact our heroes and ask what plays, films, books and music inspire them and explore those we don’t already know; ask them to mentor and guide us as we reflect on the development of our own careers – successes, failures, the projects that have brought us the most pleasure and satisfaction (are these necessarily the ones that are deemed externally to be our most successful?). Then we can draw up or revisit our artistic values and be ready for when theatre re-emerges, as it will do.
‘Seek out virtual shows’Tom Rasmussen, writer and performerIn terms of protecting vulnerable artists, a lot of people in the queer and drag communities are already responding to closures and gig cancellations by creating virtual shows via livestreaming on social media. Whether it’s interactive Facebook lives, where punters can tip via PayPal and ask for certain numbers, makeup tutorials or at-home cabaret lessons, the drag community is adapting swiftly. In a community which doesn’t trust the government for protection, people are already making work in conversation with their audiences in order to sustain themselves. You can support by seeking this out, sharing, and tipping.

‘Lobby for clarity’Sean Foley, artistic director, and Amit Sharma, deputy AD, Birmingham RepIf you can, donate prepaid tickets or have credit on your account. This will help theatres immensely. In common with other industries, people in theatre had work lined up and it has disappeared. It’s vital that we keep lobbying government for clarity and support. At Birmingham Repertory theatre we’re talking about how we can use our resources to keep creativity going for schools, early career artists and the public. As Bertolt Brecht said: “In the dark times will there be singing? Yes. There will be singing about the dark times.” We are trying to work out how to facilitate “singing” of all types and we will be back with playful, popular and pioneering theatre.
‘Come together’Rae Smith, designerWe theatre people have the wit and skills to think, create, show a view, liberate the imagination and help communicate. I’m wondering if the theatre can help out online, in the sense of creating an alternative imagined world and of reminding the nation what it is to be human. I’m aware that in small ways, such as on WhatsApp groups, we are entertaining each other in private. And how necessary it is for a perspective. Stuff can be funny even if the seriousness of the situation isn’t funny at all. But can this be more public? Can we all be more collaborative? What are the forums we could use online so that we can make inspiring stuff for everyone? On a personal note, I am using any skills I have to help anyone who asks me. My neighbour has asked me to use imagination, humour and drawing. If we are an essential help to the nation now, our audience will see the point when we open our doors again.
