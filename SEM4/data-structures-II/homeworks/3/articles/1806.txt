'This is a meltdown': Tension turns to panic on dramatic day in City

By 11am on Monday, the atmosphere on the London trading floor of spread-betting firm ETX Capital was electric.
Extra staff had been drafted in amid a surge in trading after oil prices plunged overnight and European markets tumbled due to coronavirus fears.
The usual day team of two or three traders had bulked up to nearly a dozen. Traders at the Liverpool Street office were glued to their phones, behind a wall of screens, their voices being drowned out by terminals bleating out alerts – dings, slide whistles and simulated space gun blasts – signalling fresh market moves and a flurry orders from clients.
“We’ve not seen anything like this since the financial crisis,” said Michael Baker, who leads ETX Capital’s sales team.
The firm blocked small investors from buying US stock futures due to fears that retail clients would lose too much money by taking a punt and buying on the dip. It ended up being the right call – with US futures plunging further once limits on sales were temporarily removed.

Thank you for your feedback.

The room was tense as staff prepared for the opening Wall St bell at 1:30pm. “We don’t know what’s going to happen,” one dealer said.
Within minutes, the S&P 500 was halted from trading due to a 7% fall at the open. Traders shouted across banks of desks, yelling out trades as they tried to work out which stocks were still open for orders.
“I can’t buy mate, it’s limit down,” one trader yelled. “Just tried to buy the Nasdaq – but I can’t,” said another.
One trader’s computer was firing off notifications that sounded like an air raid siren. “I’m working to sell 100 [stocks],” one trader yelled. One client was looking to sell “50% of everything” they owned.
“This is a meltdown, this is an absolute meltdown,” Baker sighed.

Some investors, however, were still looking for bargains, with one trader shouting out an order for £2m worth of US shares. “Another million sterling has come in,” another dealer shouted.
Investors rushed to put in final orders ahead of the 4:30pm European market close, and finally some calm started to return to the ETX Capital floor.
The team would drop down to two on-site traders overnight to cover the US market close and the opening of Asian trading. But thanks to coronavirus crisis preparations, staff were on call to jump on to computers from home at a moment’s notice.
“It’s all hands on deck,” Baker said.
