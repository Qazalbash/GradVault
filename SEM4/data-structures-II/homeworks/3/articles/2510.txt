Forty Australian bands couldn't play South by South West. Listen to their music here

This week, in an alternative universe devoid of coronavirus, more than 40 emerging Australian acts would have been in Austin, Texas, knee-deep in the now-cancelled South by South West, showcasing their work to the international industry in hopes of taking their careers to the next level.
“It is a huge achievement to have been selected from the 7,000-plus artists that apply each year,” said Millie Milgate, executive producer of the industry body Sounds Australia, after the conference was cancelled. “To have lost this opportunity after spending several months and thousands of dollars preparing and planning is devastating.”
Sounds Australia rallied, announcing a last-minute showcase of 18 of those artists, which would be livestreamed to international bookers, managers and publishers – and the artists’ fans – from Melbourne’s Bakehouse Studios, at 9am Friday, local time.
But even that wasn’t to be. Just four days after announcing it the organisers decided to cancel the event – which would have had some 150 people in one room at the same time – after Victoria declared a state of emergency.
It was the right decision, of course, but a double whammy for the artists who had been preparing – and saving – for months.
Here’s Sounds Australia’s playlist of songs from each of them.
