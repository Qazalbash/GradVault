• When teaching in north London in the late 1960s, one day I was approached by a colleague, a recently appointed English teacher from New York.

My colleague responded by saying “if there’s any tossing going on here, it’s going to be by me”. He wanted to know why the whole class fell about laughing.John KempCheltenham, Gloucestershire
