Leaving the EU is a mug’s game | Brief letters

At the age of 69, I tend to hide any feelings of sadness, but on reading the farewell comments of EU cultural figures (Missing you already, 1 February) and in particular Esa-Pekka Salonen’s – that we are leaving “one of the greatest ideas of unity, friendship, liberty and peace” – I cried.Julia MartenCottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire
• I’m confused by the Brexit 50p coin that says “Peace, prosperity and friendship to all nations”. Isn’t that what we joined for in the first place?Julia Draper Bath
• How fortuitous that the same day Brexit happened the coronavirus hit the UK. Now the £350m for the NHS on the side of the leave campaign bus can be put to good use building hospitals in a few weeks and treating those unfortunate enough to contract the virus. Boris Johnson really does hold all the power in his fingertips!Pam ClarkeLondon
• Thanks for your “Brexit merchandise” Pass notes (G2, 30 January), which afforded a moment of graveyard humour amid the incipient doom and desolation. I don’t see what’s so “special” about a Brexit mug, though – in 2016 there were 17.4m of them.Rob SykesOxford
• I hope all those who celebrated Brexit with a glass or two of champagne – and I am sure there were many – fully appreciated the irony.Harvey SandersLondon
