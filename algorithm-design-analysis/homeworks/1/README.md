# Homework 1
# CS 412 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Spring 2023
***

Each homework assesses your mastery over the topics covered in the course so far.

# Purpose

This homework covers algorithm analysis and design. Specific topics include: asymptotic notation, master theorem, recurrence relations, divice-and-conquer algorithms.

# Background

To attempt and submit the homework you will need
- to formulate a loop invariant and use it to prove algorithm correctness
- knowledge of techniques to solve recurrence relations
- understanding of asymptotic notation
- comfort with the mathematical tools used in the analysis of algorithms
- the ability to interpret a scenario as an algorithmic problem
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX

# Task and Submission

The task for this HW is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. You will enter your solution in the indicated space in the same file. Make sure to include in your repository any supporting files needed for successful compilation. The files in your repository at the time of the submission deadline will be considered your submission.

# Grading

The score earned by your submission will be assigned to the team assuming that the buddies contributed equally. To confirm, teams will be occasionally called in for a viva on their submission. If any of the members is unable to explain the submission or does not appear for the scheduled viva, the _team_ will lose marks for the homework. You are encouraged to report non-contributing buddies through the [appropriate form](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/2616/quizzes/7187).
