# Weekly Challenge 02: Permutations
# CS 412 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Spring 2023
***

Each Weekly Challenge (WC) invites you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. WCs may take on a variety of formats and be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. They may be attempted individually or in teams as indicated.

# Purpose

This WC invites you to think about permutations. Sorting is a common problem in computer science. The problem of sorting can be seen as choosing a single permutation from the set of all possible permutations of the given data.

# Background

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- knowledge of arithmetic series as covered in high school mathematics
- familiarity with python programming
- familiarity with `pytest`
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX

# Grading

Grading is done automatically by GitHub. It is recommended that you run `pytest test.py` locally and resolve any issues before `push`ing to your repository.

We trust that you are honesty attempting the WC and will directly award your submission the score that GitHub shows for it. To verify, you may be randomly called in for a viva on your submission. If any of the members is unable to explain the submission or does not appear for the viva, the team will be considered unreliable. Unreliable teams will be awarded a 0 in the corresponding WC as well as all WC's since their last viva.

# Task

The task for this WC is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. Your score as shown on GitHub at the time of the deadline will be your score in this WC.

# Deadline and discussion

_Deadline_: 2359h on Sun, 22 Jan

For discussion on the WC, please use the related Canvas discussion thread.

viel Spass!
